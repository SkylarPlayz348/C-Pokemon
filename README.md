## Possible FAQ:
### What Is this
This is a C version of my C ASM Pokemon project. This is based on Sun/Moon (Gen VII or 7).

For now there is not all pokemon will be added as there are so many. I will bundle 150 with this.
### Why
I want to get a good idea of how this will look in C so that I can make some of the other things in assembly.
